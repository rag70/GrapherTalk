Reverse engineer to Desmos calculator for add some functionality

For a client web application I need add a mathematical expression graphic, I found desmos  https://www.desmos.com/about, this gay give the possibility to include that in your web application, but I need control a little more, first I pass as parameter to the HTML page and after I coming with the idea to communicate directly to the graphics windows. 

I create a small Web page that Open the local Desmos sample, I add some more stuff testing too. I make a small modification to the “calculator_desktop.js” file for get access to his model and I crate a “Grapher.ts” that receive the command from the another windows page,. I this case is the Gtalk.html.
